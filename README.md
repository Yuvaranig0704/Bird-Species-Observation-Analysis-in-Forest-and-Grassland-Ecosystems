# Bird-Species-Observation-Analysis-in-Forest-and-Grassland-Ecosystems

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bird species distribution, diversity, and behavior across forest and grassland ecosystems using real-world observational data. By evaluating spatial, temporal, and environmental patterns, the goal is to draw actionable insights for conservation, eco-tourism, land management, and biodiversity monitoring.

## Objectives
- Understand the impact of habitat type (forest vs. grassland) on bird species diversity.
- Identify observation trends across time, location, and environmental conditions.
- Provide data-driven insights for conservation and ecological planning.

## Skills To Learn
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization (using Plotly/Power BI)  
- Geographic and Temporal Analysis  
- Species and Behavior Analytics  
- Streamlit App Development / Power BI Dashboarding  
- SQL (for structured data storage and access)

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Seaborn  
- **Dashboarding**: Streamlit / Power BI  
- **Database**: SQL  
- **Other**: Jupyter Notebook, Excel

## Dataset
**Bird_Observation_DataSet**  
Multiple Excel sheets representing administrative units (e.g., ANTI, CATO, CHOH). Each sheet includes detailed bird observation records with:
- Location and site info
- Bird species (common and scientific names)
- Weather conditions
- Observation timings
- Observer details
- Behavior metrics (e.g., flyover, distance, ID method)

##  Key Analysis Areas

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, normalize formats, combine sheets.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Seasonal and yearly trends
- Observer bias
- Environmental effects on sightings
- Habitat comparisons

### 3. Spatial & Temporal Insights
- Plot-wise and region-wise species richness
- Activity by season, month, time of day

### 4. Species Behavior Analysis
- Sex ratio, activity method (singing, calling, etc.)
- Distance from observer and flyover frequency

### 5. Conservation Focus
- PIF Watchlist & Regional Stewardship analysis
- Highlight vulnerable or high-priority species

## Visualization Features
- **Streamlit Dashboard** (or Power BI)
  - Filters by habitat, species, observer
  - Time series graphs, heatmaps
  - Bar plots for species counts
  - Geo-mapping of hotspots

## Business Use Cases
- **Wildlife Conservation**: Protect at-risk bird species.
- **Eco-Tourism**: Promote bird-rich areas.
- **Land Management**: Plan habitat restoration.
- **Agriculture**: Design sustainable practices.
- **Policy Making**: Inform government strategies with data.

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and documented dataset  
- Python notebooks or Power BI report  
- Interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI)  
- Summary report with insights and visualizations
